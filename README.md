How to create GitHub page:
 1. Create repository
 2. Go to repository settings
 3. Go to Pages
 4. Source = Deploy from a branch; Branch = main/chosen branch
 5. Click save

Key takeaways:
 - I was able to learn how to properly deploy a live website using GitHub repositories and GitHub's Pages feature. By using the repository as the website's link, I am able to make changes and add different features to the html
 file inside the repository, from which the website takes it's shape and layout from as the source. I was also able to understand more of pushing and updating files to the repository.
